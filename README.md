# table_prog_vite

This program consists of multiple tables, which contain rows and columns. The basic idea behind this project is that each cell has its id that is the same in every table, and these cells should not contain the same inputs, because thatâ€™s considered an error.

When an error occurs the cells light up red, and when the error goes away it returns to their normal state.
